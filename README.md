# ChineseYear.sh

Chinese hava a year name cycle of 12 years. The order of the names is as following:

In order, the 12 animals are:  Rat, Ox, Tiger, Rabbit, Dragon, Snake, Horse Goat, Monkey, Rooster, Dog, Pig,. So, since 2008 was the year of the Rat then 2008 + 12 = 2020 would again be the year of the Rat.

Write a bash  code which will take input as a year from user e.g 2008 and output the name on Chinese year.
So, in caase of 2008 the output would be "2008 was the year of the Rat.
